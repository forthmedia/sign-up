# sign-up
Modal sign up form with basic ARIA accessibility.

Includes HTML5 pattern validation and/or JavaScript custom validation. Inline comments explain how or why various validation tests are done.

It is best practice to separate and minify CSS and JS. This page is all-in-one core JavaScript with DOM manipulation, so you can read.
